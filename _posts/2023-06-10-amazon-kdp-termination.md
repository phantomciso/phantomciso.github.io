# Publishing Our First Book

Once the content was finalized and ready for printing, we chose the route of self-publishing. The obvious leader was Amazon's self-publishing platform, KDP *(Kindle Direct Publishing)*. We created a legal entity and created a new Amazon account with the books custom domain in the email address and our names inside the account as we didn't want to break any rules and keep it legit. Little did we know, we were in for an insane ride with their hyperactive brainless account flagging system.


# Account Suspension

>Using a Privacy.com card

After uploading the book, we published it, and it went live. We saw an option to order author copies for ourselves at a discounted rate, so we placed an order for two copies using a virtual credit card by privacy.com
I use privacy.com on my personal Amazon account and almost every service only as it segregates credit card numbers and ties it to one merchant. In case it gets leaked, no one else can use it. I can also "pause" or "burn" the card online.

But a few hours after we used the card, our login would not work, and we got the "Account Suspension" screen at logon. The form underneath asked us to verify the credit card information by providing an image of the card showing my name and a bank statement showing the same name and address. This was obviously not possible as privacy.com is a virtual card, and any name and zip code can be used to authorize it to maintain privacy for online orders. We filled out the form and explained this by providing a redacted screenshot of the card. After multiple calls and submissions, roughly five days later, the account was reinstated.

In this period, the book was live, and people were buying it, but we could not log into the account.

# Different Accounts, Same Login
>SSO: KDP, eCommerce, Affiliates, AWS

It's important to note that the Amazon ecosystem has multiple departments that function independently with separate support teams and their own terms and conditions. The only thing common is the login, which is a single sign-on (SSO) service to access completely different portals.

So while our main Amazon login was temporarily suspended, the KDP account was not suspended. Still, we could not access the KDP portal as the primary e-commerce account used for ordering was suspended as they shared a login.

# Account Termination
>Having the same bank account information on two different KDP accounts

In the following two weeks, we made some great sales, about 45 books, by promoting it on LinkedIn.
Then suddenly, our account status went into "*Terminated*" and the login screen said, "**This account has been closed**."
A week later, my personal account was also closed with the same message. There was no activity on my personal account. It did not seem like a coincidence.

The reason given was a generic "content violation."

Now this is where there is a serious flaw in Amazon's support system:
- We could not dispute it; the email clearly said they would NOT reinstate the account as we broke some policy they would not tell us.
- On further email inquiry, they refused to tell us the reason due to "security concerns."
- They also said they would not transfer us any royalties earned, thereby "stealing" our book income.
- We could not open a case or get phone support as that requires logging into the KDP dashboard first, which we could no longer access. Opening a support case from another account was not possible as they kept saying we had to open a case from the affected account, which was logically impossible.

At this point, it was clear that the Amazon support staff was not acting logically, rationally, or reasonably. Our frustration was real as there seemed no way through this.

We continued to reply to the automated and templated responses from KDP support on the original email thread. After 7-8 replies, their reasoning changed to "having multiple accounts." At that point, I realized that I also had a personal Amazon KDP account with the same bank account. But my personal account was in my name and social security number for tax purposes, while the book account was in the name of another legal entity (LLC) in the name of the book, with its own EIN tax number, shared by two authors. So legally, we did not have two accounts and did not break any terms. Our only mistake was to have the funds transferred to a common personal bank account, as we could not create a separate bank account for the book in time.

We were confident we had a legitimate case, but Amazon was not willing to review it for more than 5 seconds before generating a templated response every single time.

# Quick Alternative
>Ingram Spark to the rescue

The same day the KDP account got banned, we did our research and opened up an account with Ingram Spark, the largest publisher that caters heavily to self-publishing authors. We bought a new ISBN, and our book was live with them in 3 days. While our book was removed from Amazon, Ingram Spark pushed it to Amazon, so we saw it live again, but this time sold by a third party. The upside was that the book was now available in bookstores like Barnes & Noble and any other store or library that ordered it. The downside was that the shipping time was about ten days, and the margins were negligible. But at least the book was back online while we sorted out the KDP fiasco.

# Methods Tried

After spending countless hours watching youtube videos and going through forums, we realized that thousands of people were going through the same account issues. A lot of them were bestseller authors with over 20 books. Almost all of them could not resolve it for many months and gave up. I noted all the techniques mentioned and tried each one hoping that at least one method would work. (and only one works, if you're lucky)

1. ## Opening Multiple Support Cases
>Templated responses

    As mentioned earlier, you cannot open any support cases if you cannot log into your account. Other accounts cannot reference a separate account. By filling out the online form on the account closure screen, you start a new case thread. But the results were always the same. I feel they are so overwhelmed with cases that they do not give more than 5 seconds per case before clicking on a dropdown with a templated response which in most cases is completely unrelated. Like, *"content violation"* in my case for both accounts. Replies like *"We cannot offer details of our investigations"* or *"We reserve the right to terminate your account and Agreement at any time"* were also not helpful. 


1. ## Phone Support
>No help, updates cases

    While you can log into your "regular" Amazon account for product ordering, if you ask for a phone call back for a case from that portal and talk to them about your KDP account, they are unable to help. They confirm that KDP does not have phone support, and the best they can do is put a note on that case for an update. I tried this 4-5 times each on both accounts, and at best, I got another generic response on the cases with something like *"We reviewed your case and stand by our original decision."*

1. ## The Jeff Bezos Email Method
>Does not work

    A popular method online is to write an email to jeff@amazon.com
    This method does not work. I tried it nonetheless and have never gotten a response. I believe the executive team initially used this email for HR-related violations.

1. ## Chatting with KDP support members on LinkedIn 
>They ignore you

    I found quite a few individuals on LinkedIn that worked for KDP support with keyword searches like:

    - **Amazon KDP CS** (Customer Support)

    All of them are out of two countries primarily: India and South Africa (except for a few executives out of Washington State, their HQ). The following section with the org chart confirmed this as well.

    I sent a message to all of the LinkedIn contacts asking for a brief conversation. Almost all of them did not reply, and the few who did were not allowed to discuss any case-related issues outside the official channels. Another dead end.


1. ## Reaching out to the Head of Fraud
>Reviews support cases, same templated response

    I reached out to a few friends who worked in different departments of Amazon. They had access to the company phone directory and org chart. So I had them look up a few names for the KDP support staff I found on LinkedIn to see who they report to. They will have titles like:

    - **Fraud and Abuse Manager**
    - **Books Risk Management**

    I found the head of KDP customer support. I did not want to call or email them as they would question how I got their information, and they would simply not entertain any cases outside their portal. So my friend chatted with them internally. He said he would ask his team to look into it, and I only got another scripted response from their support that they stand by their decision.

1. ## Letter to WA Attorney General
>Official complaint, no follow-up

    When no human was willing to discuss the case with me, I decided to complain to the Washinton Attorney General as an official way to [file a complaint](https://www.atg.wa.gov/file-complaint) against a company headquartered in their state. The complaint goes in their public record. They are also overwhelmed with over 2000 cases a month. So, I did not expect any outcome and have yet to hear back from them.

1. ## Complaint to BBB
>Useless, don't waste your time

    A popular method is to file a complaint against a business on the Better Business Bureau website. No action is taken from them, and it only serves as a portal to look at public complaints against a company. We did not waste our time there.


1. ## Legal Demand Letter
>Threats work

    At this point, I drafted a legal demand letter using some online templates. I kept it very simple, defining the problem and that I just wanted my accounts reinstated, otherwise I would take further legal action against Amazon Inc. At this point, we found a friend who happened to be a lawyer specializing in consumer rights cases. So we hired him to send the letter instead for a better impact.
    
    You can contact him here and reference this article: [TariqLaw.com](https://www.tariqlaw.com/)

    Within a few days, Amazon's legal team sent him an email acknowledging receipt and said they would look into it.

    About ten days later, I randomly tried to log into our KDP account, and to my surprise, both the book and my personal account were reinstated. The same day I got an email from KDP support stating that they had reinstated the accounts "as a one-time exception" and that "any further violation to the content guidelines will negatively impact the account status." This was hilarious as it was clearly due to the legal threat.

    The next day our attorney got an email from Amazon's legal team saying that both accounts were reinstated on further investigation, and they apologized for any inconvenience.

1. ## Small Claims Court

    If the accounts had not been reinstated, our next step was to file a claim under the small claims court as a final step. Thankfully it did not get to that.

# Royalties Inaccessible

The book royalties dashboard still said "account closed," but it was resolved within a day after I opened a support case. It shows that all their internal portals are maintained and managed separately, often breaking the integration.

# Lesson

Some valuable lessons learned after this ordeal:

- Take the time to separate everything for your business (emails, tax IDs, bank accounts)
- Always have a redundancy plan. Publish the book on Ingram Spark and buy your own ISBN ($85). Then publish the same book under the same ISBN on KDP. People buying through Amazon will buy the print-on-demand version from Amazon with Prime benefits. If KDP bans your account, the underlying Ingram Spark version will show up and still be orderable via third-party sellers, or Amazon will order the book from Ingram and wait to ship it out after they receive it in stock. It will also be distributed to brick-and-mortar bookstores like Barnes & Noble and libraries.
- Be patient and follow through. Do not give up; all it takes is one method to succeed. Be persistent, polite, and professional. Everything is recorded and will be "on file." If you are in the right, continue the fight.

If you are in a similar situation, this experience will help you either set up your infrastructure correctly or follow the right method to resolve your issue.
